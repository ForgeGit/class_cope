> "What are the top DPS rankings for my class doing?"

This question, usually followed by looking at a couple top logs <sup>(read: "Top parses or "Top rankings")</sup> for your boss of preference, wildly over-represents what is not always a proper representation of "good gameplay", nor that of "min-maxing" (regardless of it being personal (selfish) or raid min-maxing). 

For instance, relatively easy sources of extra DPS that one can use for "min-maxing" <sup>(WCL parsing approvedâœ…)</sup> such as tailoring cloth-crafting buffs, pre-summoning guardians, or receiving external buffs (Power Infusion, Focus Magic, among others) should always be a (personal) DPS increase, and you will see them being used in **some** of the "top parses". However, this won't always be the case.

You don't __"need"__ these things to "parse", but in some cases, having some of these things will make it __more likely__ for you to "parse".

A lot of the times some of the things you see in top parses would be impossible for your own raid-conditions. For example, class-stacking sometimes is needed to meet specific DPS threshold to skip entire mechanics or boss phases.

Back in World of Warcraft: Classic - The Burning Crusade (TBC), when you could stack lust one after another, you could see some top rankings stacking externals with no skill or care on their rotation at all. This however, was not necessarily the "majority". <sub>~~Or you could say that maybe a lot of logs are massively AI generated and we don't know~~</sub>

In other words, it can be useful and interesting to use data from the top rankings/parsing/logs to see trends and some curious min-maxing techniques, however one has to be careful on how this can or not be extrapolated more generally.

This is why this is called the **__cope collection__**.

Choose whatever metric you like and use it however you like. It is cope anyways.
